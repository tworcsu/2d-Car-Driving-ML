    "The goal of the project is to teach a car to drive in a two dimensional setting across a hilly train.  Similarly to shown bellow from a online program [boxcar2d](http://boxcar2d.com/).  This project will be similar in the goal of making the car travel as far as possible on the terrain before becoming stuck.  Although it is different because instead of trying to make new cars to travel accross the terrain, the program will change the way the car drives across the terrain to try to go as far as possible.  The only control the car has is the throttle.  If the car goes to quick up a hill this will cause the car to flip over which results in an immediate failure.  If it goes to slowly it makes a bad time or may even fail to go up a hill."

    "Likely the most difficult part of this project will be to synthesize the terrain and be able to read the terrain into a training input that is useful.  For example, the height of the terrain is not so important at any point.  What is more imporant is how high the terrain at some point relative to the neighbors around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways of tacking this issue.  One of which is to interpret the terrain into WaveLets or using a Fourier Transform.  Another way to gather meaningful input from the raw terrain data is to have several height inputs for the nearest points in the terrain directly in front of the car that are relative to the car's current height.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, we will use two dumb algorithms that do not use machine learning in any way.  One will just go at a constant speed.  It can be considered to be the control.  The other will simply look at the terrain ahead.  If the terrain is sloping upward is will push forward if not, it will just coast unless it is not moving already."
